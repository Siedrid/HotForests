# HotForests 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`HotForests` is a CloudComputing Project supervised by Dr. Maninder Dhillon at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. The goal of `HotForests` is to detect hotspots in Bavarian Forest using the ERA5 climate reanalysis data from 1950 until 2024. The climate variables "temperature_2m", "total_evaporation_sum" and "total_precipitation_sum" were analysed by calculating the slope of the linear trend over the monthly anomalies of the climate parameters.


The following workflow was utilised to that end:
